    <h1>Week One Notes</h1>
    <h2>Key/Value Pairs and Local Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Key/Value Pairs:</strong> Simply put, the KEY is song title, the VALUE is the music for that song (I liked this analogy best).</p>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> It's possible to save user inputs as Key/Value pairs.<br>
        <em>QUESTION:</em> I followed along with the book to create the story editor and it mostly worked,
        but the Load Function didn't work. I added some <code>consol.log()</code> code to see what was up,
        and when I clicked the 'save' button, the <code>consol.log()</code> showed my inputs, but when I clicked
        the 'load' button the <code>consol.log()</code> showed a value of 'null'. I'm not sure why, and I don't want to spend all
        my time trying to debug something until I actually need to. I'm hypothesizing that it could a be 'localhost' issue.

    <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
    <p>Design for the smallest and least powerful device that will be using your app.</p>
    <p>"The simple guideline is whatever you are doing - do mobile first." - Eric Schmidt (World Mobile Congress Keynote, 2012)</p>
    <p>
        Do mobile first: this is great for committed web developers, but I see some issues with this.
        Mainly, that there are a LOT of people who use WYSIWYG editors for their sites. I build sites that
        small business owners can manage, they are going to make all their changes on a desktop or laptop.
        I can give them the tools to make their edits in the 'responsive editing' option, but most WYSIWYG editors
        are not built mobile first. When we build, we build on a computer, it's the easiest medium, but I'm not sure
        the average small business owner is going to take the time to use the mobile first approach.

        Note: I didn't look at the Course Material section in time to see the SitePoint Access code purchase.
        I completed the purchase today (1/9/21) but according to the online store, the code will not be emailed to be for 1-2 days.
        If I get the code today, I'll complete the course/watch the rest of the videos. If not, I'll update my notes when I'm able
        to watch the rest of the videos.
