    <h1>Week One Notes</h1>
    <h2>Key/Value Pairs and Local Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Key/Value Pairs:</strong> Simply put, the KEY is song title, the VALUE is the music for that song (I liked this analogy best).</p>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> It's possible to save user inputs as Key/Value pairs.<br>
        <em>QUESTION:</em> I followed along with the book to create the story editor and it mostly worked,
        but the Load Function didn't work. I added some <code>consol.log()</code> code to see what was up,
        and when I clicked the 'save' button, the <code>consol.log()</code> showed my inputs, but when I clicked
        the 'load' button the <code>consol.log()</code> showed a value of 'null'. I'm not sure why, and I don't want to spend all
        my time trying to debug something until I actually need to. I'm hypothesizing that it could a be 'localhost' issue.

    <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
    <h3>1) How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h3>
    <p>Design for the smallest and least powerful device that will be using your app.</p>
    <p>
        "If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content,
        and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way
        around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful."
        <br>
        -Joel Marsh - The Hipper Element
    </p>
    <p>"The simple guideline is whatever you are doing - do mobile first." - Eric Schmidt (World Mobile Congress Keynote, 2012)</p>
    <p>
        Do mobile first: this is great for committed web developers, but I see some issues with this.
        Mainly, that there are a LOT of people who use WYSIWYG editors for their sites. I build sites that
        small business owners can manage, they are going to make all their changes on a desktop or laptop.
        I can give them the tools to make their edits in the 'responsive editing' option, but most WYSIWYG editors
        are not built mobile first. When we build, we build on a computer, it's the easiest medium, but I'm not sure
        the average small business owner is going to take the time to use the mobile first approach.
    </p>

        Note: I didn't look at the Course Material section in time to see the SitePoint Access code purchase.
        I completed the purchase today (1/9/21) but according to the online store, the code will not be emailed to be for 1-2 days.
        If I get the code today, I'll complete the course/watch the rest of the videos. If not, I'll update my notes when I'm able
        to watch the rest of the videos.

    <h3>2) How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h3>
    <p>
        "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want
        until you show it to them."<br>
        -Steve Jobs - Apple
    </p>
    <p>Immediate. Relevant. Frictionless.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Immediate: BE THERE. To help move someone along their decision journey and deepen their loyalty.</li>
        <li>Relevant: BE USEFUL. Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy their needs.</li>
        <li>Frictionless: BE QUICK. It's not just about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well. (My thoughts, reduce decision fatigue)
            <ul>
                <li>The more steps the more frustration. Make it zero steps.</li>
                <li>Don't assume everyone will have the latest and greatest internet speeds. Infrastructure has to be there in order for the speeds to be there.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compress your images</li>
                    <li>Use SVG/webfonts</li>
                    <li>Minimize CSS and JS files</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3) Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h3>
    <p>Things that are clickable and commonly used should be at the bottom of the phone (primary controls).</p>
    <p><strong>Placement</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Address reachability issues</li>
        <li>Create perception of speed (because the buttons are easy to reach)</li>
        <li>Doing the above will improve user engagement rates and increase user satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Many users don't know what the hamburger icon means. Let's make it easier for people who are
        not familiar with all the icons out there. The word "Menu" inside a box (AKA a button) had
        the highest conversion rates when tested.
    </p>
    <p>Test stuff!! Don't settle for 'eh, it's fine' -- create the best experience for your visitors/users.</p>
    
    <h3>4) Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
    <p>(User Input / Forms)</p>
    <p>
        Simplify as much as possible. The less the user has to think and make decisions, the better. 
        Use form placeholders AND <em>Float Labels</em>. Only ask for the information you actually need.
        Enlarge checkboxes for mobile devices to make it easier the click with thumbs. Enable autocomplete/autofill.
        If you have a long form, consider paginating it, but be sure to include a progress bar. Make passwords showable.
        Call the correct keyboard for the matching field (number keypad for a field that asks for numbers only).
        Link phone numbers on your website! (I already do this... yay me!)
    </p>

    <h3>5) Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h3>
    <p>
        Understand how people USE their mobile devices! Do your research. Pop-up advertising and in-betweener ads SUCK.
        Make ads in the content small and simple. You can always have the ad enlarge when clicked. I personally hate all ads.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The fallen state of your Internet is a direct, if unintentional, consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support online content and service."<br>
        -Ethan Zuckerman, Creator of the Pop-up ad (he sincerely apologizes for creating the pop-up ad.)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>STOP USING POP-UPS/POP-OVERS.</li>
        <li><strong>Users don't visit your website to look at ads.</strong></li>
        <li>Keep it simple and sleek.</li>
        <li>Make sure it's unobtrusive. Content First.</li>
    </ul>
