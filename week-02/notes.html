    <h3>Chapter 2 - Programming Basics</h3>
    <p>
        Write comments in your code! You'll be grateful you did when you have to revisit an old project.
        Keep it simple and easy to understand. Comments make a master Ninja.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Statement is a <code>single line of code terminated by a semicolon;</code></li>
        <li>"A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces."<br>
            <code>{<br>
                // this is a block containing 2 statements<br>
                    const message = 'Hello!';<br>
                    alert(message);<br>
                }
            </code>
        </li>
        <li>I know the above, but I wanted to write it to cement it in my memory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There 7 type different data types, 6 of which are <i>primitive</i>. <strong>Primitive Types:</strong>
        String, Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.), Number, Boolean,
        Undefined, Null. The 7th data type is an <i>object</i>, which can be several different types
        of data... (just not the primitive ones). Basically, if it contains more than a single value,
        it's an object (think arrays, key/value pairs, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Use <code>Const</code> as often as possible, to make your code easier to read and to debug
        (sad day, I like <code>let</code> better for some reason. So silly).
    </p>
    <p>
        Global Scope (whole document) and Local Scope (only inside the block), keep the number of global variables to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Properties</i> tell us about the object or value; <i>Methods</i> allows us to manipulate
        the object or value. You can tell the difference between Properties and Methods by the (parentheses
        at the end of the Method). EX:<br>
        <code>properties.length</code> == property<br>
        <code>variable.method()</code> == method.
    </p>
    <p>
        "We can access the properties of a string using dot notation. This involves writing a dot
        followed by the property we are interested in. For example, every string has a <code>length</code>
        property that tells us how many characters are in the string." -- I didn't know that!
    </p>
    <p>
        Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers...

    <p>
        <strong>QUESTION:</strong> With the <code>parseInt('23',10);</code> - what's with the "base"
        number? What is it there for? what happens if I don't use it?

    <h3>Chapter 3 - Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
    <p>
        Note: I did a lot of reading for this chapter on my kindle, and not a lot of stuff needed
        notes (except for this note).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Nested for Loops</strong>: "You can place a loop inside another loop to create a nested loop.
        It will have an inner loop that will run all the way through before the next step of the outer loop occurs."
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>
            for(let i=1 ; j&lt;13 ; i++){<br>
                for(let i=1 ; j&lt;13 ; j++){<br>
                    console.log(`${j} multiplied by ${i} is ${i*j}`);<br>
                    }<br>
                }
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        "The outer loop counts up from <code>i=1</code> to <code>i=12</code> . For every iteration of
        the outer loop, the inner loop counts up from <code>j=1</code> to <code>j=12</code>.
        This means that it starts in the first iteration with <code>i = 1</code> and <code>j = 1</code>,
        producing the following output that is logged to the console:
        <code>&lt;&lt; 1 multiplied by 1 is 1</code>"
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
        "<code>j</code> continues to increase until it reaches 12. After this, we leave the inner loop
        and return to the outer loop, where <code>i</code> increases to 2. We then re-enter the inner
        loop and <code>j</code> is reset back to 1 and begins counting up to 12 again.
        This continues until the last iteration produces the line:
        <code>&lt;&lt; 12 multiplied by 12 is 144</code>"
    </p>

        Use a variable to precalculate the length of a list (Array) in a for loop so that it doesn't
        have to be calculated every time the loop runs. This will save speed in the long run,
        especially for large Arrays.
    </a></p>

    <h3>Chapter 4 - Functions</h3>
    <p>
        "<strong>Keep Your Code DRY:</strong> Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming
        that specifies that every part of a program should only be written once. This avoids duplication
        and means there’s no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync."
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
        "<strong>Parameters</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong> are terms that are often used
        interchangeably to represent values provided for the function as an input. There is a subtle
        difference though: any parameters a function needs are set when the function is <em>defined</em>.
        When a function is <em>invoked</em>, it is provided with arguments."<br>
        <strong>DEFINE (parameters):</strong> When we write the function.<br>
        <strong>INVOKE (arguments):</strong> When we call the function, or tell it to DO something.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Default Parameters:</strong> "The golden rule to remember here is to always put default parameters <i>after</i> all the other parameters."
    </p>
    <h4><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/4/k01nwtp9?fromShare=true" target="_blank">
        Arrow Functions
    </a></h4>
    <p>"Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, <code>=></code> that gives them their name.
        The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions
        are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable." 
        (See example/notes below.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>const square = x => x*x;</code> OR <code>const add = (x,y) => x + y;</code><br>
        <code>parameter => function;</code> OR <code>(param1, param2) => function</code><br>
        NOTE: "const square =" is the variable we are assigning the arrow function to.
        Also, a single parameter does not need to go inside parentheses, only multiple
        parameters need to go inside parentheses. "If the function doesn't require any parameters,
        a pair of empty parentheses must go before the arrow."<br>
        <code>const hello = () => alert('Hello World!');</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Single line Arrow Functions don't need to go inside a block or explicitly use the
        <code>return</code> keyword. Longer Arrow Functions still need curly braces and to go inside
        a block, as well as using the <code>return</code> keyword.
    </p>
    <p>
        "A number of the benefits are lost, once the function body becomes longer than one line.<br>
        Arrow functions make perfect candidates for short, anonymous functions, and you will often
        see them used later in the book."
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The main thing about using functions is to be consistent with the method you use. I personally
        prefer Function Declaration, so that's what I'm going to stick with (except in those instances
        where the Arrow Function is the best option for the job).<br>
        <code>function declaration() { code block }</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/4/k01nwtq1?fromShare=true" target="_blank">
            Callbacks
        </a></strong>: "Functions can ... be given as a parameter to another function.
        A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a <i>callback</i>."
    </p>
    <p>"Here’s a basic example of a function called <code>sing()</code>, which accepts the name of a song:</p>
    <p>
        <code>
            function sing(song) {<br>
                console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}`);<br>
            }<br>
            sing('Let It Go')<br>
            &lt;&lt; 'I'm singing along to Let It Go'
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>We can make the <code>sing()</code> function more flexible by adding a callback parameter:</p>
    <p>
        <code>
            function sing(song,callback) {<br>
                console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`);<br>
                callback();<br>
            }
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>The callback is provided as a parameter, then invoked inside the body of the function."</p>

        Sorting Arrays With A Callback</a>: I do not get this at all. I mean, I get the callback, but I 
        sure don't understand how that function works.
    </p>
    <p><em>(Short Arrow Functions are very useful as Callbacks)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Map Method Callback:</strong> In this instance, we usually only reference the first parameter,
        the ITEM in the array, but there are two more parameters that can be called. INDEX NUMBER and the ARRAY itself.<br>
       <strong>SO:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Item</strong> in the array.</li>
        <li><strong>Index Number</strong> of the array.</li>
        <li><strong>The Array</strong> itself.</li>
    </ol>
