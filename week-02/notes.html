        Write comments in your code! You'll be grateful you did when you have to revisit an old project.
        Keep it simple and easy to understand. Comments make a master Ninja.

    <ul>
        <li>A Statement is a <code>single line of code terminated by a semicolon;</code></li>
        <li>"A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces."<br>
            <code>{<br>
                // this is a block containing 2 statements<br>
                    const message = 'Hello!';<br>
                    alert(message);<br>
                }
            </code>
        </li>
        <li>I know the above, but I wanted to write it to cement it in my memory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There 7 type different data types, 6 of which are <i>primitive</i>. <strong>Primitive Types:</strong>
        String, Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.), Number, Boolean,
        Undefined, Null. The 7th data type is an <i>object</i>, which can be several different types
        of data... (just not the primitive ones). Basically, if it contains more than a single value,
        it's an object (think arrays, key/value pairs, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        Use <code>Const</code> as often as possible, to make your code easier to read and to debug
        (sad day, I like <code>let</code> better for some reason. So silly).
    </p>
    <p>
        Global Scope (whole document) and Local Scope (only inside the block), keep the number of global variables to a minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Properties</i> tell us about the object or value; <i>Methods</i> allows us to manipulate
        the object or value. You can tell the difference between Properties and Methods by the (parentheses
        at the end of the Method). EX:<br>
        <code>properties.length</code> == property<br>
        <code>variable.method()</code> == method.
    </p>
    <p>
        "We can access the properties of a string using dot notation. This involves writing a dot
        followed by the property we are interested in. For example, every string has a <code>length</code>
        property that tells us how many characters are in the string." -- I didn't know that!
    </p>
    <p>
        Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers...

            I straight-up do not get this section - linking in case I need to refer back to it.

    <p>
        <strong>QUESTION:</strong> With the <code>parseInt('23',10);</code> - what's with the "base"
        number? What is it there for? what happens if I don't use it?
